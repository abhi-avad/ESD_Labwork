### Embedded Systems and Devices Laboratory Repo
###### 6th Semester, BTech, UVCE (2023 Batch)


This repository contains code written from scratch for LPC2148 microcontroller from NXP.
The code was written primarily using the [user manual for LPC214x family](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/UM10139.pdf) and tested on the kit available in college.

UART and I2C code was verified using a [logic analyzer on a raspberry pi zero](https://github.com/gusmanb/logicanalyzer).
